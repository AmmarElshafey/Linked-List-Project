## Linked List Project
This C++ project implements a basic singly linked list. It demonstrates fundamental operations on a linked list such as inserting elements at the beginning, at the end, and before a specific element, deleting an element, checking if an element exists, and displaying the list.

## Features

The program offers the following functionalities:

1. **Insert at the beginning**: Adds an element to the start of the linked list.
2. **Insert at the end**: Adds an element to the end of the linked list.
3. **Insert before a specific element**: Inserts an element before a given value in the list.
4. **Delete an element**: Removes a specific element from the linked list.
5. **Check if an element exists**: Searches for an element in the list.
6. **Display the list**: Outputs the entire linked list to the console.
7. **Count the elements**: Displays the number of elements in the list.
8. **Check if the list is empty**: Verifies if the linked list has any elements.

## Structure

The program consists of two primary components:

- **Node structure**: Each node holds an integer value (`data`) and a pointer (`next`) to the next node in the list.
- **LinkedList class**: This class manages the linked list and provides the functions to manipulate the list.

## How to Use

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the program.
